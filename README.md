Project Cybele, my ever-evolving Python-based chatbot â€“ think of it as a digital attic about something's and little cheat sheet for the themes bellow mentioned that just happened to achieve a stable beta release in August 2024. Built upon core components of my previous chatbot Zorie framework and serving as a cornerstone of the Vorian extension, Cybele try to employs diverse programming techniques and two distinct chatbot algorithms without using NLP or NLPK modules. While you can certainly leverage other AI platforms to build your own chatbot, Cybele offers a unique, curated experience.

Sporting a retro-inspired design reminiscent of classic consoles and terminals, Cybele functions as a comprehensive knowledge repository. It delivers insights across a wide spectrum of domains, ranging from practical life advice aligned with the "Make a Difference Daily" ethos to in-depth celestial exploration, encompassing planetary dynamics, an astronomical glossary, lunar phases, and stellar constellations. Meticulously curated geographical, environmental, and technological data, including historical artifacts and terminology, are also readily available. To enhance computational precision, Cybele incorporates the Haversine formula for distance calculations and sophisticated algorithms for determining sunrise, sunset, and seasonal variations.

Further expanding its capabilities, Cybele features a fundamental periodic table providing essential element information. Engaging interactive games focused on capitals, constellations, and periodic table elements are integrated to reinforce learning and enhance user engagement. Notably, Cybele is designed with the particularity of working in offline mode and boasts the potential to run on Android or iOS devices via a Python interpreter (version 3+).
